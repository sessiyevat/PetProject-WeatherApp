# PetProject-WeatherApp

In this project I used Current Weather API from https://openweathermap.org. 
[I also wanted to work with forecast data, since It was paid, I didn't want to spent time for searching other available APIs. So, in houly and daily forecast sections I used the current temperature.]

#### Framework: UIKit
#### Design pattern: MVC
#### Auto layout library: SnapKit
